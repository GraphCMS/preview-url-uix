# Preview URL UI Extension for GraphCMS

## Why I've created this UIX

Currently, GraphCMS doesn't have an icon or link to preview content from table view. You should open an item to edit and them click to preview it.

This extension adds a link in the content table view, so that you have a shortcut to preview your content.
